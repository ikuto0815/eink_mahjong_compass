This folder contains the 3D models for the case. compass_square.FCStd is the freecad project containing everything.

In the stl folder are stl files for the individual parts that can be directly used for 3D printing.

The files `case.stl`, `display_feet.stl`, `lid.stl` each have to be printed once.

To keep the battery in place either `battery_frame_500mah.stl` (105080 LiPo) or `battery_frame_600mah.stl` (906090 LiPo) can be used. For other battery formats either that part has to be modified or the battery could just be glued to the case.

The parts `button_holder.stl` and `button.stl` each have to be printed 4 times and then glued to the botton of the lid.
